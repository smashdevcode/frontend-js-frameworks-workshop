# Frontend JavaScript Frameworks Workshop

## Survey

* Who is already using one of these frameworks?
* Which of these are you most interested in learning something about?

## Goals

* The goal of this talk isn't to tell you everything that you need to know about these frameworks in order to be successful
  * It wouldn't be possible to do that for just one of these frameworks let along three
* The goal is to give you an impression of what it'd be like to work with each of these frameworks so that you can decide which you may want to take a closer look at
  * Or if you're already using a framework, whether or not it'd make sense for you to take a closer look at a different framework

## Out of Scope

There's so much to talk about... something's got to go!

* Routing
* State Management
* Universal Rendering
* Mobile Development

## What We'll Cover

(Basic) Component Development

* Templating
* Properties
* Events

## Prerequisites

* Did everyone get a chance to install the prerequisites?
* Why are Node.js and npm required?
  * Used to support the tooling that's typically used for React, Angular, and Vue development
  * Not necessary on the server (just need a server that can serve static files)

## Exercises!!!

See the files in the "exercises" folder

## Highlights and Opinions

### React

* Pros - Relatively simple, elegant in its design, focus on functional programming, broad community support, approach encourages you to decompose your app into smaller and smaller components
* Cons - Can feel a bit constraining or foreign at times, many ways to accomplish the same thing (i.e. less opinionated), you can't leverage native HTML (and sometimes even CSS)

### Angular

* Pros - Capable CLI, all inclusive, opinionated, leverages native HTML and CSS, for a longtime C# dev, coding in TypeScript feels comfortable (and safe)
* Cons - Relatively verbose, can feel heavy handed or overly complex at times, difficult to getted started without the assistance of the CLI

### Vue

* Pros - Downgraded mode is brilliant (and more importantly, it's fun!), less opinionated (especially when compared with Angular), leverages native HTML and CSS
* Cons - Less community support (at this time), no "one way" to setup projects

## Making a Choice

### How do you decide on which to use?

* What does your dev team look like?
* What kind of app are you building?
* What features are most important to you?

### Performance

Is one framework the clear leader in performance?

[http://www.stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark7/table.html](http://www.stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark7/table.html)

Performance, in most cases, is probably as not as much of a differentiating factor as it maybe once used to be

### Other Considerations

* CLIs
* Forms
* Universal or Server-side Rendering
* Mobile Dev
* Docs
* Learning Resources
* Tooling Support
* Popularity
* Support
* Community

## Wrap Up

### Don't Over Think It

* You can be successful with any of these frameworks
  * Arguing over which of these is better is a little like arguing over which ice cream flavor is "better"

### Shared Concepts

What are the conceptual things that you need to know in order to be successful with any of these frameworks?

* SPAs
* Components
* Templating and Binding
* Virtual DOM
* Data Flow
* State Management
* Backend APIs
* Routing
* Language Abstractions
* Testing
* Front End Builds

As you learn and gain skill with these concepts you can apply them to any framework, current or future

### Conclusion

* Things will continue to change and evolve
* Picking the "right" framework is important, but it's more important to focus on the core concepts and skills that front end devs need to have in order to be successful
  * That will also equip you for whatever comes next... because you better believe that something new is right around the corner
* Don't worry too much about it... just make a choice and do your best :)
