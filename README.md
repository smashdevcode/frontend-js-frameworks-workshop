# Frontend JavaScript Frameworks Workshop

## Survey

* Who is already using one of these frameworks?
* Which of these are you most interested in learning something about?

## Goals

* The goal of this talk isn't to tell you everything that you need to know about these frameworks in order to be successful
  * It wouldn't be possible to do that for just one of these frameworks let along three
* The goal is to give you an impression of what it'd be like to work with each of these frameworks so that you can decide which you may want to take a closer look at
  * Or if you're already using a framework, whether or not it'd make sense for you to take a closer look at a different framework
